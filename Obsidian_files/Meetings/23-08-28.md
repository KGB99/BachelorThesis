## Proposal
Assume:
- Calibrated camera set
- Know the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters
- Have ground truth information through the marker tracking -> Can calculate ground truth mask from this
Goal: 
- Train model to estimate bounding boxes
- Find modal and amodal mask

Methodology:
- We show overview of state of the art and compare the models
	- One Yolo as baseline: Works realtime
	- Compare to transformer based model
- We have similar background all the time, compared to benchmarks such as COCO
- Synthetic Data: (further options after comparing state of the art)
	- Could use only synthetic data and see how well it compares to real data (option 1)
	- Could use synthetic data and refine with real data
	- Train on synthetic data and use Segment Anything as refinement (option 2)
		- Get bounding box using synthetic data and use segment anything to choose box
		- unknown yet how to exactly use segment anything
